# Java Learning Progress

## Overview
This repository documents my journey in learning Java programming language. I have covered a wide range of topics including Java basics, data types, software development life cycle (SDLC), typecasting, methods, classes, objects, constructors, looping control constructs, control constructs, and various pattern problems and programs.

## Accomplishments
- Mastered Java basics including data types, variables, and operators.
- Understand the importance of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in Java development.
- Proficient in typecasting for handling different data types in Java.
- Implemented methods for modular programming and code reusability.
- Learned about classes and objects, and their role in object-oriented programming.
- Utilized constructors for initializing objects in Java.
- Demonstrated proficiency in using looping control constructs like for, while, and do-while loops.
- Implemented control constructs including if-else statements and switch-case statements for decision making.
- Solved various pattern problems and programs using Java.

## Learning Path
- Started with Java basics to build a strong foundation.
- Progressed to advanced topics such as classes, objects, and constructors.
- Practiced extensively on looping and control constructs to enhance problem-solving skills.
- Engaged in solving pattern problems and programs to apply theoretical knowledge into practical scenarios.

## Next Steps
